# Crypto Learning and Thoughts
This is a collection of my notes and journey about learning about cryptocurrencies and blockchains

My first real interest in crypto came about when I heard about MEV. In early 2022 and late 2021, many individuals were making a killing by employing highly profitable trading strategies (hehe) by using MEV. This prompted me to do brief research on it and Ethereum at large, and I took notes at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eGu0Hv8pT7X7sGeXjLPkvHW_mTCRnsVYtdInEd-b95I/edit?usp=sharing. 

One important part of the emerging crypto landscape has been the rampant occurrences of hacks of various protocols and projects. In the last year alone we've seen billions of dollars in total losses across the industry. From Wormhole to Beanstalk to Nomad, it seems like there's a hack just waiting around the corner. 

Then I learned about the whitehack movement, with immunefi.com arguably at the forefront of the effort. I found that the opportunities to help safegaurd crypto projects was +ev not only because there are handsome payouts for finding bugs, but because you get to be a hero of sorts (kind of corny but it's true) by helping to protect peoples' money. A highly touted resource for learning about smart contract development, security, and whitehackery was https://medium.com/immunefi/hacking-the-blockchain-an-ultimate-guide-4f34b33c6e8b.

I started to go down the list of recommended resources including the Ethereumbook (https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook), CryptoZombies (which I blazed through), Ethernaut, and much more. My notes are at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLOUJHqfqOTKeDbP3SgJEh_WdvevouKBiy78FBnY1V4/edit.

After seeing the $10 million Wormhole bounty that was awarded to satya0x (https://twitter.com/satya0x) and various multimillion bounties that were awarded to pwning.eth (https://twitter.com/PwningEth), my main focus is evaluating projects from immunefi when time permits. I'll admit that it's definitely not easy to learn about protocols and projects front to back and try to find mistakes that the developers overlook themselves, but at the very least I get to learn by reading, bit by bit. 

If there's one thing I could change/improve about the current way we write smart contracts, it's how proxy deployments work. I understand the notion of swapping the implementation while data stays unchanged, but the manner in which it happens is quite unsatisfying, since contracts deployed to Ethereum are meant to be immutable (interesting dichotomy). If done poorly for complicated projects, it feels like a dangling attack vector.

UPDATE: actually, upgradeable smart contracts are done pretty nicely, I was wrong. 

These are just some of thoughts about what I've learned so far and I hope I have much more to add on in the future.
